This was a final project for a data science class. It explores the effectiveness of different legislature in preventing gun violence in the US state-by-state.

The correlations that were found cannot be taken as *proof* that certain laws are more effective in reducing gun violence, however they provide compelling evidence that more research should be done in the area. There does appear to be some evidence that certain types of laws are more effective than others, but we must also be careful to note that these laws do not exist in a vacuum.
